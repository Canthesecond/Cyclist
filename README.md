# Scenario
You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago.** The director
of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore,
your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently.** From these insights,
your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives
must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data
visualizations.

# Business Task
The goal of this case study is to identify how do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently.
This comparison along with other tasks will later be used by marketing department for developing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into members.

In this project data is given to us from a realiable source therefore ROACC test is not required by my judgement.

The stakeholders for this projects are;

-Primary stakeholders: The director of marketing and Cyclistic executive team

-Secondary stakeholders: Cyclistic marketing analytics team
 
 # Data Processing
 Before I start analyzing the dataset, it is necessary to make sure data is clean, free of error and in the right format.
 
 I decided to use R to clean the data because it is easy to work with big datasets. You can find the details in the pdf version in the project folder.
 
 I used Tableau for the visualization purposes. Please click [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/canthesecond/viz/Cyclist_project/Cyclist_dashboard) to see the visualized data. 
 
 **Since there are around 2 million rows, I have used R because it is easy to use with large dataset.**
